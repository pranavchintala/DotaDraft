Dota 2 is quickly growing in terms of volume of players, as well as increased attention on the global E-Sports platform. As the prize pool for this year's tournament was $25 million,analysis on various aspects of the game is becoming increasingly valuable. A critical aspect of the game is the initial drafting phase, where teams execute a ban/pick of the heroes they would like to use. Many times we see the outcome of games being decided on this very factor. I would like to build a pipeline capable of assisting players in this drafting phase in order to increase their win rates. My pipeline will utilize historical data to find out which heroes are strong in certain situations. Dota 2 is a quickly evolving game and as such, the current patch (meta) also plays a role in determining powerful hero picks.
